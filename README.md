index.js
Light/Dark Mode Toggle

Toggles between light and dark modes when clicking on an image element.
Changes background colors, background images, and adjusts element styles (color, background) accordingly.
Manages toggling between light and dark mode by manipulating DOM elements based on the state (num variable).
Todo List Initialization

Initializes an array (arr) containing hardcoded tasks with properties (text and checked).
Todo List Functionality (Expected)

Defines a function todos() for managing and rendering the todo list based on arr.
Placeholder function that should include logic for adding, updating, and deleting tasks, interacting with the DOM, and potentially using functions from crud.js.
2. utils.js
renderTaskTemplate(task)
Generates an HTML string template for rendering a task item.
Uses template literals to dynamically insert task details (id, title) and conditionally applies classes and button texts based on task.completed.
3. app.js (Partial Overview)
Event Listeners

Handles form submissions (addTaskForm.addEventListener('submit', ...)) and button clicks (addTaskButton.addEventListener('click', ...), updateTaskButton.addEventListener('click', ...)).
Uses FormData to capture form data for creating and updating tasks.
Calls CRUD operations (createTask(task), updateTask(task_id, task), deleteTask(task_id)) defined in crud.js.
fetchTasks()

Fetches tasks from the server (BASE_URL) using fetch() with GET method.
Updates the task list displayed in the UI (tasklist.innerHTML) based on fetched data.
Handles errors (catch) and logs them to the console.
4. crud.js (Partial Overview)
CRUD Operations
Defines functions for CRUD operations (createTask(task), updateTask(task_id, task), deleteTask(task_id), fetchTask(task_id), fetchTasks()).
Uses fetch() API to interact with a RESTful API (BASE_URL) for tasks.
Handles asynchronous operations with async/await for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting tasks.
Manages headers (Authorization) for authentication and content types (application/json).

Overall Integration
Functionality Flow

index.js initializes the application with light/dark mode toggle and basic task data.
app.js manages UI interactions and event listeners, calling CRUD operations from crud.js.
crud.js interacts with the server-side API (BASE_URL) to perform CRUD operations on tasks.
utils.js provides utility functions (renderTaskTemplate) for rendering task items in a standardized format.
Application Workflow

User interactions (like adding, updating, deleting tasks) trigger event listeners in app.js.
Event handlers call appropriate CRUD functions in crud.js to update data on the server and fetch updated data.
Updated data is rendered in the UI using renderTaskTemplate and DOM manipulation techniques.
This architecture allows for a structured and modular approach to building a task management application with dynamic UI updates, server interaction, and user-friendly features like light/dark mode toggling. Each JavaScript file (index.js, utils.js, app.js, crud.js) plays a crucial role in managing different aspects of the application's functionality and user experience.
